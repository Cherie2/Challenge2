# Cherie Walker Portfolio-C02

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is to draft a portfolio utilizing some newly cultivated skills in CSS. This portfolio allows the ability to showcase a variety of projects that are completed or in progress. Additional details such as education, experience, and contact information will also be provided in this platform. Users including potential employers, will be able to gain a quick, but thorough glimpse of my progress in web development. 

In order to create this web design and have it be appealing to the user both in function and aesthetically, there are many CSS elements required such as flexbox, CSS variables, and media queries. As a result of compiling this portfolio, I have learned the concept of responsive web design. 
**There are a few placeholders for projects that are planned, but not quite underway. Those images will not have active links.
